## Installation

Simply clone then in your terminal inside the directory run `npm i` to install all dependencies then `npm run dev` to start the server. Go to your browser and head to `http://localhost:3001` to see the output (by default, but you can change it in the `package.json` at `"dev": "next -p 3001"` and change the **3001** to a port of your preference).
